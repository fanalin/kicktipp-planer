# kicktipp-planer
This is an app for managing tournaments. 

The name `kicktipp-planer` indicates the original use-case 
(for managing Tipp-Kick tournaments, see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipp-Kick), but usage for other 
sports is possible as well. In fact, there are no specifics implemented for any sports.

# Usage in your own installation
You'll need a firebase account and add your credentials to src/js/firebase-config.js if you want to have 
your own installation of this tool. For the login, you'll need to enable google- and email-login in your 
firebase console.
